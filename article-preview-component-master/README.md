## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The share button was quite challenging because I wasn't very clear on absolute and relative positioning in css. 

Didn't manage to change the color of my svg and didn't want to integrate it directly in my file.

### Continued development

I will keep searching this svg topic because I'm sure it's not that complicated.
