## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Grid positionning using a "virtual grid" in CSS = mind blown

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  grid-template-areas:
        ". b ."
        "a b d"
        "a c d"
        ". c .";
}
```
